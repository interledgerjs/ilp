This is a low-level interface to ILP, largely intended for building ILP into other [Application layer](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/tree/master/0001-interledger-architecture) protocols.

#### The ILP Client includes:

* [Interledger Payment Request (IPR)](#interledger-payment-request-ipr-transport-protocol) Transport Protocol, an interactive protocol in which the receiver specifies the payment details, including the condition
* [Pre-Shared Key (PSK)](#pre-shared-key-psk-transport-protocol) Transport Protocol, a non-interactive protocol in which the sender creates the payment details and uses a shared secret to generate the conditions
* Interledger Quoting and the ability to send through multiple ledger types using [Ledger Plugins](https://github.com/interledgerjs?utf8=âœ“&q=ilp-plugin)

#### The ILP Client does **not** handle:

* Account discovery
* Amount negotiation
* Communication of requests from recipient to sender

## Installation

`npm install --save ilp ilp-plugin-bells`

*Note that [ledger plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ilp-plugin) must be installed alongside this module*


## Interledger Payment Request (IPR) Transport Protocol

This protocol uses recipient-generated [Interledger Payment Requests](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0011-interledger-payment-request/0011-interledger-payment-request.md), which include the condition for the payment. This means that the recipient must first generate a payment request, which the sender then fulfills.

This library handles the generation of payment requests, but **not the communication of the request details from the recipient to the sender**. In some cases, the sender and receiver might be HTTP servers, in which case HTTP would be used. In other cases, they might be using a different medium of communication.

### IPR Sending and Receiving Example

```js
'use strict'

const co = require('co')
const ILP = require('ilp')
const FiveBellsLedgerPlugin = require('ilp-plugin-bells')

const sender = ILP.createSender(i
  _plugin: FiveBellsLedgerPlugin,
  prefix: 'ilpdemo.red.',
  account: 'https://red.ilpdemo.org/ledger/accounts/alice',
  password: 'alice'
})

const receiver = ILP.createReceiver({
  _plugin: FiveBellsLedgerPlugin,
  prefix: 'ilpdemo.blue.',
  account: 'https://blue.ilpdemo.org/ledger/accounts/bob',
  password: 'bobbob'
})

co(function * () {
  yield receiver.listen()
  receiver.on('incoming', (transfer, fulfillment) => {
    console.log('received transfer:', transfer)
    console.log('fulfilled transfer hold with fulfillment:', fulfillment)
  })

  const request = receiver.createRequest({
    amount: '10',
  })
  console.log('request:', request)

  // Note the user of this module must implement the method for
  // communicating payment requests from the recipient to the sender
  const paymentParams = yield sender.quoteRequest(request)
  console.log('paymentParams', paymentParams)

  const result = yield sender.payRequest(paymentParams)
  console.log('sender result:', result)
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log(err)
})

```

### Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Transport Protocol

This is a non-interactive protocol in which the sender chooses the payment
amount and generates the condition without communicating with the recipient.

PSK uses a secret shared between the sender and receiver. The key can be
generated by the receiver and retrieved by the sender using a higher-level
protocol such as SPSP, or any other method. In the example below,
the pre-shared key is simply passed to the sender inside javascript.

When sending a payment using PSK, the sender generates an HMAC key from the
PSK, and HMACs the payment to get the fulfillment, which is hashed to get the
condition. The sender also encrypts their optional extra data using AES. On
receipt of the payment, the receiver decrypts the extra data, and HMACs the
payment to get the fulfillment.

In order to receive payments using PSK, the receiver must also register a
`reviewPayment` handler. `reviewPayment` is a callback that returns either a
promise or a value, and will prevent the receiver from fulfilling a payment if
it throws an error. This callback is important, because it stops the receiver
from getting unwanted funds.

### PSK Sending and Receiving Example

```js
'use strict'

const co = require('co')
const ILP = require('.')
const FiveBellsLedgerPlugin = require('ilp-plugin-bells')

const sender = ILP.createSender({
  _plugin: FiveBellsLedgerPlugin,
  account: 'https://localhost/ledger/accounts/alice',
  password: 'alice'
})

const receiver = ILP.createReceiver({
  _plugin: FiveBellsLedgerPlugin,
  account: 'https://localhost/ledger/accounts/bob',
  password: 'bobbob',
  // A callback can be specified to review incoming payments.
  // This is required when using PSK.
  reviewPayment: (payment, transfer) => {
    if (+transfer.amount > 100) {
      throw new Error('payment is too big!')
    }
  }
})

co(function * () {
  yield receiver.listen()
  receiver.on('incoming', (transfer, fulfillment) => {
    console.log('received transfer:', transfer)
    console.log('fulfilled transfer hold with fulfillment:', fulfillment)
  })
  const sharedSecret = receiver.generateSharedSecret()

  // Note the payment is created by the sender
  const request = sender.createRequest({
    destinationAmount: '10',
    destinationAccount: 'example.ilp.address.for.bob',
    sharedSecret: sharedSecret
  })
  console.log('request:', request)

  const paymentParams = yield sender.quoteRequest(request)
  console.log('paymentParams', paymentParams)

  const result = yield sender.payRequest(paymentParams)
  console.log('sender result:', result)
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log(err)
})
```
